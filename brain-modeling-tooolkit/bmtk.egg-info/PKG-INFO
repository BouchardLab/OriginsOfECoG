Description: # The Brain Modeling Toolkit
        
        A software development package for building, simulating and analyzing large-scale networks of different levels of resolution.
        
        ## Level of Support
        We are releasing this code to the public as a tool we expect others to use. Questions concerning bugs and related issues are welcomed. We expect to address them promptly, pull requests will vetted by our staff before inclusion.
        
        
        ## Quickstart
        bmtk requires Python 2.7 plus [additional python dependicies](https://alleninstitute.github.io/bmtk/index.html#base-installation). To install with
        base requirements from a command-line:
        
        ```bash
         $ git clone https://github.com/AllenInstitute/bmtk.git
         $ cd bmtk
         $ python setup.py install
        ```
        
        There are examples of building models and running simulations located in docs/examples/. Some of the simulation engines may require additonal requirements to run.
